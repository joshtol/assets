# **📦 joshtol/assets**

### **A central repository for shared brand assets, logos, and icons used across my projects.**

## **🏛️ Why This Repository Exists**

This repository provides a single, canonical location for all shared visual assets. The benefits include:

* **Consistency:** Every project will use the exact same version of an asset.  
* **Easy Updates:** To update a logo, you only need to change the file here. All projects linking to it will automatically receive the update.  
* **Organization:** Keeps individual project repositories clean and focused on their own code.

## **🚀 How to Use These Assets**

To use an asset in one of your projects, you must link to its **raw file URL**.

1. **Navigate to the Asset:** Click through the folders to find the asset you need (e.g., /logos/wild-research-logo.svg).  
2. **Click the "Raw" Button:** On the file view page, click the "Raw" button.  
3. **Copy the URL:** Copy the URL from your browser's address bar.  
4. **Use in an \<img\> Tag:** Use the copied URL as the src for an \<img\> tag in your HTML.

### **Example**

\<img   
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshtol/assets/main/logos/wild-research-logo.svg"   
  alt="Wild Research Logo"   
  style="height: 100px; width: auto;"
